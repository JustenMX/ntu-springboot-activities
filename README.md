## Introduction

This repository serves as a showcase of my journey through the Spring Boot exercises and activities in the NTU Software Engineering course. It includes solutions to various programming challenges and concepts taught during the course. In addition to the course exercises, I've also included some of the projects I've independently developed.

## Getting Started

If you're a fellow student or developer interested in Spring Boot, feel free to explore the exercises and projects in this repository. You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JustenMX/nut-springboot-activities
```

Each activity is stored in its respective folder, and you can navigate to each activity to find the Spring Boot files and BRIEF.md with specific instructions.

### Accessing Activity Instructions

Each activity is organized within its respective folder. To find the instructions for each activity, follow these steps:

1. Locate the `resources` folder in the project directory.

2. Inside the resources/documentation folder, you will find the `BRIEF.md` file.

3. Open the `BRIEF.md` file to access detailed instructions and guidelines for the activity.

Here's a quick example:

Suppose you want to access the instructions for the "springboot-workshop." You would follow this path:

```
springboot-workshop/
└── src/
    └── main/
        └── resources/
            └── documentation/
                └── BRIEF.md

```
