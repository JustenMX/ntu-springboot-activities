Create a new Spring Boot project

- Create a path pointing to `GET:/products/{productId}`.
  - It returns the phrase "This is detail for ID: productId"
  - if the ID is 1, "Product Name: Apple"
  - if the ID is 2, "Product Name: Banana"
  - if the ID is 3, "Product Name: Carrot"
  - And it should return "No product found" if ID is >= 4.
