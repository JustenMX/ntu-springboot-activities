### Brief

Using the Maven repository, import slf4j framework and springboot starter web in the attached zip file.

Create the following routes:

1. GET /products -> returns a sample Product object
2. POST /products -> gets product name, price, description from RequestBody and creates a new Product object.

Create the necessary files and controllers as needed. Use logging whenever the path is called.
